**Project Overview:**
March 13th of 2020, Timor Leste experienced an extreme weather event which cost millions of dollars for the Dili urban area.

The event  data was recorded by weather stations owned  by GoTL and Similie.\

With data on hand the idea of leveraging Machine Learning in order to better predict these type of events was reinforced.


Similie is currently running trials with a new Artificial Intelligence Model based on the stations of Dare and Dili.

It relies only on historical data of the local station.

**Model Overview:**
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - Recurrent Neural Network (Deep Learning). 
- LSTM has been widely used for weather forecasting algorithms, energy and water consumption and stock market prediction models. 
- Base Features: Temperature, Dew Point, Temperature and Dew Point Variance,  Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed and Wind Direction.

**Outcomes:**
- 24 hour forecast values for Temperature and Dew Point. 
- The convergence of Temperature and Dew Point predictions indicates a strong probability of precipitation. 
- Output accuracy is currently estimated at 79.29%.

**Improve current models:**
- Move to production can increase the models self-learning rate without human intervention.
- Learn and integrate better machine learning evaluation techniques. 
- Integrate Global Weather Forecast Models with our ML Models. 

**Impact on Flood EWS:**
- Incorporate future data from Dili EWS project, such as soil moisture, river level data and local weather conditions into existing models.
- Assess results alongside standard approaches to understand if AI presents a benefit.
- Test ML Models in new catchments.
- Develop a communications approach to improve understanding within Government.
- Improve visualization of AI results in One platform for EWS.

**Explore AI in new concepts:**
- Predict impact of time without rain on rainfall/runoff curve.  
- Understand water availability within a catchment.
- Forecast Fire Index values.
- Use satellite timeseries images to better understand climate trends.
